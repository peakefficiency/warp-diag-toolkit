Here is a plan for implementing a modular file parser in Golang:

1. Start by creating a main package that will be the entry point of the application.

2. Create a function to extract the log files from the zip file and store their contents in memory. You can use the "archive/zip" package in Golang to achieve this.

3. Create a function to parse the configuration file in YAML format. You can use a third-party library like "go-yaml" to parse the YAML file into a struct.

4. Implement a search function that takes the parsed configuration and the log lines as input. Iterate through each log line and check if it matches any of the search terms specified in the configuration file. If a match is found, store the log line and its corresponding issue type in a struct.

5. Implement a report generating function that takes the search results as input. Use the issue type to retrieve the corresponding reply from the configuration file. Combine the reply with the log lines that match the issue type and format them into a report. The format of the report should be orthogonal to the search function, meaning it can be changed independently.

6. Test the modular file parser by providing sample log files and the configuration file. Ensure that the search function correctly identifies the matching log lines and the report generator generates the expected report.

7. Optionally, you can add additional functionalities like command-line arguments to specify the input files, error handling, and logging.

8. Document your code with comments to explain the purpose and functionality of each function. Use meaningful variable and function names to enhance code readability.

Remember to import the necessary packages and dependencies in your code.
